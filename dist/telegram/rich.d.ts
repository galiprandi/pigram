/**
 * Bot API 10.1 Rich Message support for markdown tables.
 *
 * Telegram's HTML parse mode has no <table> primitive, so pigram renders
 * tables as a fixed-width <pre> grid. That works but is static: no borders,
 * no horizontal scroll on narrow phones. Bot API 10.1 added sendRichMessage,
 * which accepts raw markdown and renders GFM pipe tables as NATIVE bordered
 * tables the client can scroll horizontally.
 *
 * This module is deliberately small: it answers two questions.
 *
 *  1. does this reply contain a GFM table? (should we attempt rich at all)
 *  2. did rich delivery fail for a PERMANENT reason? (stop trying this session)
 *
 * Everything else — sending, editing, fallback to HTML — stays in preview.ts
 * and index.ts so the failure paths remain exactly where they are today.

 * Transient failures (network, 5xx, rate limit) do NOT qualify: the message
