 *  1. The reasoning is internal — the user asked for the answer, not the chain
 *     of thought.
 *  2. `<thinking>` is not a Telegram-allowed HTML tag, so leaving it in makes
 *     Telegram reject the formatted message and the bridge falls back to plain
 *     text, losing all rich formatting for that reply.
 *
 * Handles unclosed tags (truncated/streamed reasoning) by dropping everything
 * from an opening tag to end-of-string when no closing tag is present. Matching
 * is case-insensitive and tolerant of surrounding whitespace.
